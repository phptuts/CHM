## What is an LED?

A light-emitting diode. It's an electrical component that emits light and allows electricity to flow only one way.  An LED has a short side and a long side.  The long side the positive side and the short side is the negative side.

## What is a push button?

A button that, when pushed down, allows electricity to flow from one side of the button to the other side of the button.

## Steps

1\. Connect a jumper wire from one of the Arduino's GND to the - side of the breadboard.

2\. Connect the short side of your blue LED into hole (5, e) and the long side into (7, e).

3\. Connect one of the ends of your resistor into the hole (5, a) and the other end into the a - hole in the breadboard.

4\. Connect a jumper wire from (7, a) to pin 10 of the Arduino.

5\. Let's test this out with code and upload it.  Follow the video instructions here.  Ignore the other LEDs for now.
